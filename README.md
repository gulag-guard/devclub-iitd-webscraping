The bonus task for codeforces is simple enough to implement by putting a for loop that starts from current contest and goes backwards.
Also, the screenshot function for chromedriver is flawed in my code, i.e. it cannot take full screenshot of web element. Some area always gets cropped out. I have managed to get the largest possible size of the problem statement, but I think gecko driver makes it possible to take screenshot of full window.
